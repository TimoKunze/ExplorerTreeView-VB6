- Bugfix: Auto-scrolling during drag'n'drop and probably some other things didn't work correctly.

Version 1.12.0 - 12/08/2006
===========================
- Added Windows Vista support including the following new features:
	- "AutoHScroll" scrolls the control automatically in horizontal direction to display as much of the selected item as possible.
	- "FadeExpandos" fades the item buttons in, if the user moves the mouse cursor over the control, and out, if he moves it out of the control.
- New feature: Use the property "DontCheckFolderExpandibility" to tell the control to make all folders expandable without searching for real sub-items (which can be very time-consuming).
- New feature: Use the property "hWndShellUIParentWindow" to specify a window that will be used as parent window for any UI that will be displayed by the Windows Shell. If set to 0, many messages won't be displayed at all.
- Rewrote the "DimSelectedItemsIcon" feature (Backport from ExplorerTreeView 2.0). Now it's a little bit more performant and works correctly on Windows Vista. However, you can't use it together with CheckBoxes anymore.
- Rewrote the "FavoritesStyle" feature. It's working perfectly now.
- Deactivated BkImage support. It caused too many problems and according to the vote, noone uses it anyway.
- Bugfix: Icons of selected files could be wrong.
- Bugfix: The control could crash mysteriously if multiple control instances were used on multiple forms. This bug existed since version 1.0.0!
- Bugfix: There was another strange bug, that crashed the control if the RootPath property was changed while AutoUpdate was updating the tree.
- Windows Vista compatibility fixes.

Version 1.11.1 - 26/01/2006
===========================
- Bugfix: AutoUpdate could crash the control if a document was sent to the printer.

Version 1.11.0 - 19/01/2006
===========================

- New feature: The event "ItemCompleteDrag" is raised after a drag'n'drop-operation. NOTE: If the dragged item was moved, the parameter "hItem" will be -1. The parameter "PerformedEffect" will be invalid if the drop target doesn't set it.
- Rewrote big parts of the control fixing several bugs and memleaks, increasing performance and improving auto-update.

Version 1.10.4 - 18/12/2005
===========================
- Bugfix: There was a memleak in a (very widely used) internal function.
- Bugfix: Path strings weren't always parsed as expected.
- Bugfix: Calling "ReloadItems" or "ReloadSubItems" could trigger the "SelChanged" event although the Path didn't change.

Version 1.10.3 - 13/11/2005
===========================
- Bugfix: The control crashed if the "CheckBoxes" property was set to "True".

Version 1.10.2 - 07/09/2005
===========================

Version 1.10.1 - 01/09/2005
===========================
- Bugfix: The displayed icons could be wrong.

Version 1.10.0 - 13/06/2005
===========================
- New feature: "UseCustomIcons" allows the usage of a custom imagelist.
- New feature: "ItemOverlayIndex" retrieves or sets an item's overlay index in the control's imagelist.
- The properties "ItemIconIndex" and "hImageList" can be set now.
- AutoUpdate no longer wastes time with updating collapsed sub-trees. Instead it simply removes those items.
- Now some of an item's properties get loaded when they are required for the first time (usually when it's displayed for the first time) instead of when the item is inserted. This reduces sub-items loading time, but results in a small performance penalty when the sub-items are displayed for the first time. This way the control feels a little bit faster.
- Improved general performance.

Version 1.9.1 - 15/05/2005
==========================
- Bugfix: The properties "ArchiveItemBackColor", "ArchiveItemForeColor", "CompressedBackColor", "CompressedForeColor", "EncryptedBackColor", "EncryptedForeColor", "HotBackColor", "HotForeColor", "SelectedItemBackColor", "SelectedItemForeColor", "DimSelectedItemsIcon", "BkImage" and "FavoritesStyle" didn't work anymore.

- New feature: "ItemIconIndex" returns an item's icon index in the control's imagelist.

- Minor performance tweaks.

- Updated the About dialog.

Version 1.8.7 - 14/10/2004
==========================

- Bugfix: The control crashed on Windows 95 (and probably also on Windows 98/Me) while enumerating the content of the control panel.
- Bugfix: Code which decides whether an item is part of the recycle bin was buggy. This caused crashes on Windows 95 (and probably also on Windows 98/Me) related to AutoUpdate.
